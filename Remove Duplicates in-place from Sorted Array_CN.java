/*
Problem Statement: Given an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

If there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of the array should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.
Example 1:
Input:
 arr[1,1,2,2,2,3,3]

Output:
 arr[1,2,3,_,_,_,_]

Explanation:
 Total number of unique elements are 3, i.e[1,2,3] and Therefore return 3 after assigning [1,2,3] in the beginning of the array.

 /* Solution 1: Brute Force
Intuition: We have to think of a data structure that does not store duplicate elements. So can we use a Hash set? Yes! We can. As we know HashSet only stores unique elements.

Approach: 

Declare a HashSet.
Run a for loop from starting to the end.
Put every element of the array in the set.
Store size of the set in a variable K.
Now put all elements of the set in the array from the starting of the array.
Return K.

Time complexity: O(n*log(n))+O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

Solution 2: Two pointers
Intuition: We can think of using two pointers ‘i’ and ‘j’, we move ‘j’ till we don't get a number arr[j] which is different from arr[i]. As we got a unique number we will increase the i pointer and update its value by arr[j]. 

Approach:
Take a variable i as 0;
Use a for loop by using a variable ‘j’ from 1 to length of the array.
If arr[j] != arr[i], increase ‘i’ and update arr[i] == arr[j].
 After completion of the loop return i+1, i.e size of the array of unique elements.

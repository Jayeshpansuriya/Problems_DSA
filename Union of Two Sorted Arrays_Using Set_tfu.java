Union of Two Sorted Arrays

1
Problem Statement: Given two sorted arrays, arr1, and arr2 of size n and m. Find the union of two sorted arrays.

The union of two arrays can be defined as the common and distinct elements in the two arrays.NOTE: Elements in the union should be in ascending order.

Examples
Example 1:
Input:

n = 5,m = 5.
arr1[] = {1,2,3,4,5}  
arr2[] = {2,3,4,4,5}
Output:

 {1,2,3,4,5}

Explanation: 

Common Elements in arr1 and arr2  are:  2,3,4,5
Distnict Elements in arr1 are : 1
Distnict Elemennts in arr2 are : No distinct elements.
Union of arr1 and arr2 is {1,2,3,4,5} 

Example 2:
Input:

n = 10,m = 7.
arr1[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
arr2[] = {2,3,4,4,5,11,12}
Output:
 {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}
Explanation:
 
Common Elements in arr1 and arr2  are:  2,3,4,5
Distnict Elements in arr1 are : 1,6,7,8,9,10
Distnict Elemennts in arr2 are : 11,12
Union of arr1 and arr2 is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}

Solution 2: Using Set
Suppose we consider arr1 and arr2 as a single array say arr,  then the union of arr1 and arr2 is the distinct elements in arr.

Example:
arr1[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
arr2[] = {2,3,4,4,5,11,12} 
arr = arr1 + arr2 = {1,2,3,4,5,67,8,9,
                     10,2,3,4,4,5,11,12}

Distinct element in 
arr = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12} 
    = Union of arr1 ,arr2.
So using a set we can find the distinct elements because the set does not hold any duplicates. Hence we can find the union of arr1 and arr2.

Why not unordered_set?
In unordered_set the elements are stored in random order, while in a set the keys are stored in sorted order (ascending order by default). As we require elements of the union to be in ascending order, using a set is preferable.

We can also use unordered_set, but after finding the union of arr1 and arr2, we need to sort the union vector to get the elements of the union in sorted order.

Time Compleixty : O( (m+n)log(m+n) ) . Inserting an element in a set takes logN time, where N is no of elements in the set. At max set can store m+n elements {when there are no common elements and elements in arr,arr2 are distntict}. So Inserting m+n th element takes log(m+n) time. Upon approximation across inserting all elements in worst, it would take O((m+n)log(m+n) time.

Using HashSet also takes the same time, On average insertion in unordered_set takes O(1) time but sorting the union vector takes O((m+n)log(m+n))  time. Because at max union vector can have m+n elements.

Space Complexity : O(m+n) {If Space of Union ArrayList is considered} 

O(1) {If Space of union ArrayList is not considered}

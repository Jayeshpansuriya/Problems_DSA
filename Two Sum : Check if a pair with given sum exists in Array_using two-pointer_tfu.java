/*
Problem Statement: Given an array of integers arr[] and an integer target.

1st variant: Return YES if there exist two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, return NO.

2nd variant: Return indices of the two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, we will return {-1, -1}.

Note: You are not allowed to use the same element twice. Example: If the target is equal to 6 and num[1] = 3, then nums[1] + nums[1] = target is not a solution.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {2,6,5,8,11}, target = 14
Result: YES (for 1st variant)
       [1, 3] (for 2nd variant)
Explanation: arr[1] + arr[3] = 14. So, the answer is “YES” for the first variant and [1, 3] for 2nd variant.

Example 2:
Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {2,6,5,8,11}, target = 15
Result: NO (for 1st variant)
	[-1, -1] (for 2nd variant)
Explanation: There exist no such two numbers whose sum is equal to the target.

Optimized Approach(using two-pointer): 

Intuition: In this approach, we will first sort the array and will try to choose the numbers in a greedy way.

We will keep a left pointer at the first index and a right pointer at the last index. Now until left < right, we will check the sum of arr[left] and arr[right]. Now if the sum < target, we need bigger numbers and so we will increment the left pointer. But if sum > target, we need to consider lesser numbers and so we will decrement the right pointer. 

If sum == target we will return either “YES” or the indices as per the question.
But if the left crosses the right pointer, we will return “NO” or {-1, -1}.

Approach:

The steps are the following:

We will sort the given array first.
Now, we will take two pointers i.e. left, which points to the first index, and right, which points to the last index.
Now using a loop we will check the sum of arr[left] and arr[right] until left < right.
If arr[left] + arr[right] > sum, we will decrement the right pointer.
If arr[left] + arr[right] < sum, we will increment the left pointer.
If arr[left] + arr[right] == sum, we will return the result.
Finally, if no results are found we will return “No” or {-1, -1}.
Dry Run: Given array, nums = [2,1,3,4], target = 4

First, we sort the array. So nums after sorting are [1,2,3,4]

We take two-pointers, left and right. The left points to index 0 and the right points to index 3.

Now we check if nums[left] + nums[right] == target. In this case, they don’t sum up, and nums[left] + nums[right] > target so that we will reduce right by 1.

Now, left = 0, right=2

Here, nums[left] + nums[right] == 1 + 3 == 4, which is the required target, so we will return the result.

                return "YES";

/*
Note: For variant 2, we can store the elements of the array along with its index in a new array. Then the rest of the code will be similar. And while returning, we need to return the stored indices instead of returning “YES”. But for this variant, the recommended approach is approach 2 i.e. hashing approach.

Time Complexity: O(N) + O(N*logN), where N = size of the array.
Reason: The loop will run at most N times. And sorting the array will take N*logN time complexity.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

Note: Here we are distorting the given array. So, if we need to consider this change, the space complexity will be O(N).

23

2
Problem Statement: You are given an array of ‘N’ integers. You need to find the length of the longest sequence which contains the consecutive elements.

Examples
Example 1:
Input:
 [100, 200, 1, 3, 2, 4]

Output:
 4

Explanation:
 The longest consecutive subsequence is 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Input:
 [3, 8, 5, 7, 6]

Output:
 4

Explanation:
 The longest consecutive subsequence is 5, 6, 7, and 8.

  /*
Better Approach(Using sorting): 
We can simply sort the array and run a for loop to find the longest consecutive sequence.

Algorithm:
We will consider 3 variables, 
‘lastSmaller’ →(to store the last included element of the current sequence), 
‘cnt’ → (to store the length of the current sequence), 
‘longest’ → (to store the maximum length).
Initialize ‘lastSmaller’ with ‘INT_MIN’, ‘cnt’ with 0, and ‘longest’ with 1(as the minimum length of the sequence is 1).
The steps are as follows:

First, we will sort the entire array.
To begin, we will utilize a loop(say i) to iterate through each element one by one.
For every element, we will check if this can be a part of the current sequence like the following:
If arr[i]-1 == lastSmaller: The last element in our sequence is labeled as 'lastSmaller' and the current element 'arr[i]' is exactly 'lastSmaller'+1. It indicates that 'arr[i]' is the next consecutive element. To incorporate it into the sequence, we update 'lastSmaller' with the value of 'arr[i]' and increment the length of the current sequence, denoted as 'cnt', by 1.
If arr[i] == lastSmaller: If the current element, arr[i], matches the last element of the sequence (represented by 'lastSmaller'), we can skip it since we have already included it before.
Otherwise, if lastSmaller != arr[i]: On satisfying this condition, we can conclude that the current element, arr[i] > lastSmaller+1. It indicates that arr[i] cannot be a part of the current sequence. So, we will start a new sequence from arr[i] by updating ‘lastSmaller’ with the value of arr[i]. And we will set the length of the current sequence(cnt) to 1.
Every time, inside the loop, we will compare ‘cnt’ and ‘longest’ and update ‘longest’ with the maximum value. longest = max(longest, cnt)
Finally, once the iteration is complete, we will have the answer stored in the variable ‘longest’.
Note: Here, we are distorting the given array by sorting it.

        System.out.println("The longest consecutive sequence is " + ans);

/*
Time Complexity: O(NlogN) + O(N), N = size of the given array.
Reason: O(NlogN) for sorting the array. To find the longest sequence, we are using a loop that results in O(N).

Space Complexity: O(1), as we are not using any extra space to solve this problem.

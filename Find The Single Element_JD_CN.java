/*
Problem statement
You are given a sorted array 'arr' of positive integers of size 'n'.



It contains each number exactly twice except for one number, which occurs exactly once.



Find the number that occurs exactly once.



Example :
Input: ‘arr’ = {1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4}.

Output: 2

Explanation: 1, 3, and 4 occur exactly twice. 2 occurs exactly once. Hence the answer is 2.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1:
5
1 1 2 2 3


Sample Output 1:
3


Explanation of sample output 1:
{1, 2} each occurs twice, whereas 3 occurs only once.
Hence the answer is 3.


Sample Input 2:
5
8 8 9 9 10


Sample Output 2:
10


Expected time complexity :
The expected time complexity is O(n), but try solving it in O(log n).


Constraints:
1 <= 'n' <= 10^4
1 <= 'arr[i]' <= 10^9

‘n’ is always odd.

Time Limit: 1 sec

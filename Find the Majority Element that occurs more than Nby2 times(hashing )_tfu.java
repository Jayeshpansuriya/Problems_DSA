Find the Majority Element that occurs more than N/2 times

Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers, write a program to return an element that occurs more than N/2 times in the given array. You may consider that such an element always exists in the array.

Examples
Example 1:
Input Format
: N = 3, nums[] = {3,2,3}
Result
: 3
Explanation
: When we just count the occurrences of each number and compare with half of the size of the array, you will get 3 for the above solution. 

Example 2:
Input Format:
  N = 7, nums[] = {2,2,1,1,1,2,2}

Result
: 2

Explanation
: After counting the number of times each element appears and comparing it with half of array size, we get 2 as result.

Example 3:
Input Format:
  N = 10, nums[] = {4,4,2,4,3,4,4,3,2,4}

Result
: 4

  /*
Intuition:
Use a better data structure to reduce the number of look-up operations and hence the time complexity. Moreover, we have been calculating the count of the same element again and again - so we have to reduce that also.

Approach: 
Use a hashmap and store as (key, value) pairs. (Can also use frequency array based on the size of nums) 
Here the key will be the element of the array and the value will be the number of times it occurs. 
Traverse the array and update the value of the key. Simultaneously check if the value is greater than the floor of N/2. 
If yes, return the key 
Else iterate forward.


Time Complexity: O(N*logN) + O(N), where N = size of the given array.
Reason: We are using a map data structure. Insertion in the map takes logN time. And we are doing it for N elements. So, it results in the first term O(N*logN). The second O(N) is for checking which element occurs more than floor(N/2) times. If we use unordered_map instead, the first term will be O(N) for the best and average case and for the worst case, it will be O(N2).

Space Complexity: O(N) as we are using a map data structure.

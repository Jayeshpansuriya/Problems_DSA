/*
Given the row number n. Print the n-th row of Pascal’s triangle.

Our first observation regarding Pascal’s triangle should be that the n-th row of the triangle has exactly n elements. With this observation, we will proceed to solve this problem.

Naive Approach
In this approach, for every column from 1 to n, we will calculate the element (n, c)(where n is the given row number and c is the column number that will vary from 1 to n) using the previous method. Thus, we will print the row.  

Algorithm / Intuition
In this approach, for every column from 1 to n, we will calculate the element (n, c)(where n is the given row number and c is the column number that will vary from 1 to n) using the previous method. Thus, we will print the row.  

Approach:
The steps are as follows:

We will use a loop(say c) to iterate over each column i.e. from 1 to n. And for each column, we will do the following steps:
First, we will consider n-1 as n and c-1 as r.
After that, we will simply calculate the value of the combination using a loop. 
The loop will run from 0 to r. And in each iteration, we will multiply (n-i) with the result and divide the result by (i+1).
Finally, we will print the element.
Finally, the entire row will be printed.

            res = res * (n - i);
            res = res / (i + 1);
        }
        return res;

        // printing the entire row n:
        for (int c = 1; c <= n; c++) {
            System.out.print(nCr(n - 1, c - 1) + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();

/*
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(n*r), where n is the given row number, and r is the column index which can vary from 0 to n-1.
Reason: We are calculating the element for each column. Now, there are total n columns, and for each column, the calculation of the element takes O(r) time where r is the column index.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

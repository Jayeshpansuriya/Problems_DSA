Stock Buy And Sell


27

1
Problem Statement: You are given an array of prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on an ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Examples
Example 1:
Input:
 prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output:
 5
Explanation:
 Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and 
sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.

Note
: That buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 
is not allowed because you must buy before 
you sell.

Example 2:
Input:
 prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output:
 0
Explanation:
 In this case, no transactions are 
done and the max profit = 0.

  /*
Intuition: We can simply use 2 loops and track every transaction and maintain a variable maxPro to contain the max value among all transactions.

Approach: 

Use a for loop of ‘i’ from 0 to n.
Use another for loop of j from ‘i+1’ to n.
If arr[j] > arr[i] , take the difference and compare  and store it in the maxPro variable.
Return maxPro.
